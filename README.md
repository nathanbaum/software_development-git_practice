## Review:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article (and its subjects) think about innovation in an interesting and delightfully analytical way: namely, that they apply a mathematical model to the inherently social and amorphous concept of innovation. Personally, I have trouble even discerning what real innovation is and separating it from the hype and buzz-words of businesses trying to sell themselves as the next Oculus. But I find the reduction of such a complex topic to first principles oddly comforting, as if, in a way, being able to see the thing makes it less scary. This article is a bit more than a year old, but I still found the concepts new and interesting to me. Terms like [Heaps' Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaps%27_law) and [Zipf's Law](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law) were certainly terms I had never heard before, but after their explanations, made perfect intuitive sense.

Anyway, it's worth a read if you've got the time!
